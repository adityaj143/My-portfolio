## üßæ My Experience

I built this personal portfolio as part of the Devtown Tailwind Bootcamp to sharpen my frontend development skills. It helped me gain confidence in creating fully responsive websites using Tailwind CSS without relying on any external CSS frameworks. Through this project, I learned to structure HTML semantically, handle light/dark mode, manage form submissions, and implement scroll animations, which greatly improved my design sense and practical frontend abilities.
